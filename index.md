My name is Krish Eswaran. I am a senior staff software engineer in [Google Research](https://research.google/people/krish-eswaran/) 
and lead multiple teams focused on applications of deep learning, transformer-based architectures, and novel algorithms 
on real-world problems, some of which has been published in the [_Nature_ family](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93967-2)
and health-focused journals. Here is a [recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYSOl1TEXvk) 
about our group's work in multimodal medical AI. We have also studied how these solutions will perform 
in clinical settings, which you can read more about in 
this [blog post](https://blog.google/technology/health/artificial-intelligence-breast-cancer-screening/).

I have been fortunate to work in a number of teams incubating new ideas at Google, including (in reverse chronological 
order) Google Health, Google Fiber, and YouTube. At YouTube, I was the technical lead for the 
parallel media transcoding pipeline that powered live streaming of the 2012 London Olympic Games and won YouTube an
[Engineering Emmy](https://www.tubefilter.com/2013/10/21/youtube-technology-and-engineering-emmy-award/).

Prior to Google, I received a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, 
Berkeley, focused on information theory. You can find my [papers and patents](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I5gPRf0AAAAJ&hl=en) 
on Google Scholar.

In my spare time, you might find me biking, cooking, or [performing comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieTduFNExQ0).
