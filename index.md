My name is Krish Eswaran. After 15 years at Google, I have left to explore some ideas that I find meaningful.

Prior to that, I was a senior staff software engineer in
 [Google Research](https://research.google/people/krish-eswaran/) 
and led multiple teams focused on applying artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems, 
some of which have been published in the [_Nature_ family](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-021-93967-2)
and health-focused journals (e.g. [_The Lancet_ family](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/landig/article/PIIS2589-7500(23)00227-3/fulltext) and [_New England Journal of Medicine AI_](https://ai.nejm.org/doi/abs/10.1056/AIoa2400018)). Here is a [recent talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nYSOl1TEXvk) 
about our group's work in multimodal medical AI. We also studied how [these solutions will perform 
in clinical settings](https://blog.google/technology/health/artificial-intelligence-breast-cancer-screening/).

I have been fortunate to work on projects incubating new ideas at Google, including (in reverse chronological 
order) Google Health, Google Fiber, and YouTube. At YouTube, I was the technical lead for the 
parallel media transcoding pipeline that powered [live streaming of the 2012 London Olympic Games](https://www.sfgate.com/tech/article/youtube-streams-olympics-to-64-nations-3758791.php) and won YouTube an
[Engineering Emmy](https://www.tubefilter.com/2013/10/21/youtube-technology-and-engineering-emmy-award/).

Prior to Google, I received a PhD in Electrical Engineering and Computer Sciences at the University of California, 
Berkeley, focused on information theory. You can find out more on [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=I5gPRf0AAAAJ&hl=en).

In my spare time, you might find me biking, cooking, or [performing comedy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ieTduFNExQ0).
