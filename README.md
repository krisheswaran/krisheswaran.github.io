I lead research and engineering teams in [Google Research](https://research.google/people/krish-eswaran/) focused on
applications of deep learning, transformer-based architectures, and novel algorithms on real-world problems, with
applications in healthcare and other fields.

My teams' research broadly considers how the combination of AI accelerators, the latest machine learning methods, and
large amounts of data to enable novel applications, including multimodal AI.
