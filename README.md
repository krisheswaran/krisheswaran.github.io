My name is Krish Eswaran. I am a senior staff software engineer in [Google Research](https://research.google/people/krish-eswaran/) 
and lead multiple teams focused on applications of deep learning, transformer-based architectures, and novel algorithms 
on real-world problems, with applications in healthcare and other fields. Here is a recent preprint of the team's work.

My teams' research broadly considers how the combination of AI accelerators, the latest machine learning methods, and
large amounts of data to enable novel applications, including multimodal AI. We have also studied how AI will perform 
in clinical settings, which you can read more about in 
this [blog post](https://blog.google/technology/health/artificial-intelligence-breast-cancer-screening/).

I have been fortunate to work in a number of teams incubating new ideas at Google, including (in reverse chronological 
order) Google Health, Google Fiber, and YouTube. At YouTube, I was the technical lead for Hydra, the 
parallel media transcoding pipeline that powered live streaming of the 2012 London Olympic Games and won YouTube an
[Engineering Emmy](https://www.tubefilter.com/2013/10/21/youtube-technology-and-engineering-emmy-award/).
