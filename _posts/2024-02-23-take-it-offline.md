title: "Let's Take This Offline (Or My Bookshelf)"

We had a lot of books. So many books that our first purchase together was a
 bookshelf. And still, they wouldn't all fit, so we had to say our goodbyes 
to some. Where Aarti and I had two copies of the same book, things were easy,
 but this only applied to our taste in fiction.

When it came to non-fiction, most of my books were from grad school, and a
decade had passed since I'd graduated. I had started managing double-digit 
sized teams at that point and asked myself how much I'd realistically be able
to stay technical. This was also around the time that Marie Kondo had reached
 peek popularity, and I took a hard look at my bookshelf to determine what
 still sparked joy. I kept Durrett's _Probability: Theory and Examples_ while
 saying goodbye to Billingsley's _Probability and Measure_. Yes to Feller
 (volumes I and II). No to Emanuel Parzen's _Stochastic Processes_. Goodbye
_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_. Goodbye, Gallager's
 _Information Theory and Reliable Communication_. I'll miss you most of all.

This was at the start of a pandemic. Places closed. Then they opened again
 with some restrictions. We started leaving the house again. We stepped 
into a nearby bookstore. As I walked to the math and science section, I 
was surprised by the lack of Dover or Springer books. In their place were 
popular math and science books. I went to other bookstores and noticed the 
same pattern. Occassionally, there would be a stray Dover at a used bookstore
or a _Six Not So Easy Pieces_, but by and large bookstores had konmaried these
books out.

I searched online. Some of the books I had given away were out of print. I felt
a sense of loss, so I tried to find a constructive way to cope. Yes, I went 
on a book shopping spree. This was around the time that text to imeage models 
were becoming popular, and I was playing around with stable diffusion to create
 AI art, so I leaned into getting back some probability and statistics books 
including some new ones focused on machine learning. Welcome back, Casella and
Berger. It's been too long, Noga Alon.

My favorite addition to the shelf has been Kevin P. Murphy's two-volume
_Probabilistic Machine Learning_. It's a tour de force through so many of the 
algorithms and approaches surrounding both what we experience in our software
today, grounded in explanations that should be accessible to anyone with a
 solid foundation in probability theory and statistics. It's the one I find
myself picking up the most often, flipping to random pages based on something 
I had thought about on that given day. And it's made me feel more connected 
technically to the work that is happening on the teams I manage as well as 
the broader research community. It sparks joy.
