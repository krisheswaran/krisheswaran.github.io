"This place is kind of like a Vipassana retreat for founders," he tells me as
I dip my pita into the sumac-dusted hummus. We're at 
[HF0, one of the mansions](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/31/magazine/ai-start-up-accelerator-san-francisco.html)
that offers a residency for startup founders to incubate their ideas.
Unlike Y Combinator's incubator program, HF0 founders stay in the mansion
over the course of the residency. Hence, the Vipassana retreat analogy. HF0
offers community dinners on Friday evenings, and the dinner is one of the 
catalysts in my decision to leave Google.

I filed my PhD disseration in Berkeley on a Thursday afternoon, which gave me
a three-day gap before starting what became a fifteen-year stint at Google.
 When I think back to the days in between, the main event that marked the
 transition from graduate to tech employee was the
[Festival of Harps](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2009/09/26/oakland-harp-festival-spotlights-the-classical-instrument/)
at the Chapel of the Chimes. The event included Karma Moffett's indelible
Tibetan Bell Experience, which I still reminisce about with the friends who
attended with me. They have since moved to Toronto.

Instead of a Vipassana retreat, a hacker residency, or a harp festival, Aarti 
and I are in SFO, waiting to board a flight to Toronto. In addition to the
friends with whom I attended that harp festival, Aarti's brother has moved
there, and I can't think of a better way to reset than to spend time in a
different setting catching up with loved ones.
