"This place is kind of like a Vipassana retreat for founders," he tells me as
I dip my pita into the sumac-dusted hummus. We're at 
[HF0, one of the mansions](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/05/31/magazine/ai-start-up-accelerator-san-francisco.html)
that offers a residency for startup founders to incubate their ideas.
Unlike Y Combinator's incubator program, HF0 founders stay in the mansion
over the course of the residency. Hence, the Vipassana retreat analogy. HF0
offers community dinners on Friday evenings, and the dinner is one of the 
catalysts in my decision to leave Google.

Before I joined Google, I was finishing my PhD in Berkeley, which I filed on a 
Thursday afternoon, and which then gave me three days before starting what
became a fifteen-year stint at Google. When I think back to the three days in 
between, the main event that marked the transition was a
[Festival of Harps](https://www.eastbaytimes.com/2009/09/26/oakland-harp-festival-spotlights-the-classical-instrument/)
at the Chapel of the Chimes, an event that included Karma Moffett's indelible
Tibetan Bell Experience, that I still discuss with the friends who attended
with me, who have since moved to Toronto.

Instead of a Vipassana retreat, a hacker residency, or a harp festival, Aarti 
and I are in SFO, waiting to board a flight to Toronto. In addition to Aarti's 
brother, the friends I attended that harp festival with have since moved there, 
and I can't think of a better way to reset than to spend time in a different
setting catching up with loved ones.
