title: "How my time at an ISP shaped how I view AI businesses"

“Spectrum licenses don’t depreciate.” “Yes, the operating margins are
 huge, but the capex is large. Look at Comcast’s debt-to-equity ratio.”
 “Build-to-demand is a viral marketing campaign that makes the
 installations cost-effective.” “Content acquisition eats at the margins
 of providing television service, but people don’t want OTT.” “The operating
 expenses for business customers are significantly higher.”

The job doubled as a business class. When I joined Google Fiber in 2012, it had
 a hundred or so employees, an order of magnitude smaller than the thousands at
 YouTube. That meant visibility into every aspect of the business. Understanding
 those mechanics benefited me significantly in the roles I have taken since.
 Here are two examples that serve as instructive use cases:

1. Connecting a home to the Internet requires an up front investment, but once
 established, is relatively inexpensive to operate, resulting in a high
 operating margin. Furthermore, customers tend to be sticky. Thus, a company
 that is able to handle the capital expenditures to connect homes, could, given
 a large enough user base, benefit from the healthy operating margins to offset
 that cost. It’s also worth noting that certain investments to provide
 connectivity, like spectrum licenses, are assets that don’t depreciate, so
 they effectively function as cash and could be sold at a later date.

2. Internet providers charge a lot for TV service because customers want it.
 Unlike the Internet connection itself, the cost of providing that content on a
 monthly basis is high, so the margins are very low. However, because other
 ISPs also offer TV service, this becomes table stakes in order to have parity
 with one’s competition. There are multiple ways to respond to this. One is to
 make up for the low margins with high volumes, which is what the largest
 providers are able to do. Another is to bundle the television service with
 [higher margin offerings (triple play)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_play_(telecommunications)).
 A third could simply be to encourage
 customers to use
 [over-the-top services](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Over-the-top_media_service)
 instead of their own TV offering,
 which may reduce revenue but depending on the price point could actually
 increase profits.

I’ve thought back to these examples when thinking about how the AI landscape
 might evolve. There are currently multiple companies spending a lot of money
 to build large models. The bet is that there will be a way to recoup these
 costs by charging customers for the privilege of using these models (even
 [so-called open models have language around this](https://opensourceconnections.com/blog/2023/07/19/is-llama-2-open-source-no-and-perhaps-we-need-a-new-definition-of-open/)).
 If costs for updating and serving these models could eventually be reduced,
then one could image a a business model similar to an ISP’s connection to
 the home.[^1]

[^1] There is also a world in which either some of those costs do not come down and/or some data to train these models needs to be purchased/licensed, in which case the business model may resemble something more like TV service.

What about downstream business customers of these AI services? If the costs of serving these models cut significantly into their margins, then they are in a similar position to the TV service. Options available to them may  include making up for the lower margins through higher volumes, bundling their AI product with a higher margin offering, or developing a strategy in which the cost associated with using these models does not scale with the size of their business.

It’s early days for AI companies, who themselves have an interest in creating a healthy ecosystem to nurture business investment in this space. As these AI models continue to amaze me in the art of the possible, I am equally excited to see how the business models evolve.
