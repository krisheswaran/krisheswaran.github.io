We were both foam rolling at Glen Park's neighborhood gym when he asked me how
long I'd been at Google.

"15 years."

"I've been at Apple for 11."

"Do you think you'll stay?"

"Yeah, I'm a lifer."

Two hours earlier, I had turned in my laptop, corporate phone, and badge at
Google's San Francisco office. When I got home, Aarti told me that despite my
mentions of wanting to do something new, she had just assumed that I was too 
attached to my team to leave Google. She was proud of me.

The final meetings I've had with Google colleagues over the past few weeks have
centered around a related question: what caused me to change from a Google
"lifer" to an entrepreneur? Indeed, there were opportunities that I had
passed up before to stay at Google.
As a technical person living in the Bay Area, the past 15 years have been
riddled with moments in which recruiters, start ups, former colleagues, and
friends have tried to entice me to join them in a compelling venture. At times,
I'd even entertained these conversations, only to be offered a project at
Google that made the proposed external one seem less appealing by comparison.

The answer I have given people in those final meetings starts in December of
2022 when I started playing extensively with ChatGPT and continues into the
present, in which I was running experiments using a number of open source foundation
models in my spare time, reading papers, and opening my eyes to possibilities
outside of the company that has been my first and only full time job. Sometimes I
end the answer by describing the start ups, VCs, and potential clients I have
spoken with that gave me the conviction to pursue this new direction.

What that answer misses are the many other moments that came before it. There
were my first 20% projects at Google, at the encouragement of my managers,
which gave me the confidence to explore new ideas outside of my day-to-day.
There were the technical mentors who taught me everything from distributed
systems to applied machine learning, enabling me to delve deep into multiple
technical areas while giving me the breadth to understand a variety of
considerations when building a solution. There were the managers who taught me
the nuances of working with others and many of the soft skills that enabled
me to be effective in navigating a variety of hurdles.
Then there were the many opportunites to lead technical efforts, in which 
I was [working directly with clients](https://thenextweb.com/news/nbc-partners-with-youtube-to-deliver-video-services-for-the-london-2012-olympics)
and learning what was a must-have and what was an optimization for later.
There was the time I got to participate inside
[an Alphabet startup](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CMtZhGWRS3o) and learn
a lot more about the nuances of a business. There were the times I started to
manage people and teams, in which I learned how to navigate a number of
difficult situations, pivot where necessary, take risks along the way, and
learn from both successes and failures. There were the moments in which I
[helped identify](https://news.northwestern.edu/stories/2019/05/artificial-intelligence-system-spots-lung-cancer-before-radiologists/) new
[external partners](https://blog.google/technology/health/artificial-intelligence-breast-cancer-screening/),
and learned how to build trust with their organizations. All these moments
suggest that my experiences at Google have played an outsized role in incubating
the confidence and experience leading up to the present.

And for that, I am greatful for the many people I met over the years 
for helping me here. The coming months will no doubt involve a
number of new experiences that will challenge me, but I think the foundations I
have developed have given me the grit with which to engage with these.
Thank you, and stay tuned for updates as I embark on this new venture.
