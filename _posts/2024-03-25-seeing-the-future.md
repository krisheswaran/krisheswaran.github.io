title: "Seeing the Future"

In the early nineties, I saw a glimpse of what it would be like 
to 
[carry a smartphone in the not-too-distant future](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qbK-Bo3k9KQ). Several weeks later, I saw a window into a future with
[digital photos and car-based GPS systems](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NCGmxk3H44g).

Rewatching old episodes of
[Beyond 2000](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beyond_Tomorrow_(TV_series)) offers
a window into how future versions of ourselves might view the current moment, 
as well as the different strategies companies took to try to introduce novel
ideas into the market. Many of the designs end up being either an accessible 
wedge for the later disruptive technology (e.g. Kodak photo CDs for analog
cameras) or a bit too forward-looking to be practical (the wearable computer 
that holds a CD player).

I've been thinking a lot about how to find the sweet spot in technology that
 both shows the future while capturing value to benefit people today. 
Does it start by showcasing 
 [the art of the possible](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31894144/) and then
 adapting those concepts into
 [real world use cases](https://blog.google/technology/health/artificial-intelligence-breast-cancer-screening/).
Who are the partners one can engage with to get early feedback on whether an 
idea is moving in the right direction? Here, I've come across another video, an 
interview of
 [NVIDIA's Jensen Huang at Stanford](https://youtu.be/nVxH-oFV3Yk?feature=shared).
Unlike old episodes of _Beyond 2000_, something tells me this video will still
be relevant thirty years from now.
